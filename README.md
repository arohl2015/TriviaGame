# TriviaGame

##### This week's assignment: #####
* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

##### Any issues faced:
* This game appears to have glitches when it runs on the GitHub server. When running off a local server, the photos and timer run as expected. When running on Github, sometimes the photos will stick to the next transition and the right/wrong answer will show the answer for the previous question.
